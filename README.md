## 🧬 Tracing Gut Microbial Diversity and Keystone Taxa in Indian Tribes: Interplay of Lifestyle, Ecology, and Health

This repository hosts the analytical framework, scripts, and metadata associated with a comprehensive study of gut microbiota across five Indian tribal populations. The project investigates how lifestyle transitions, ecological environments, and acculturation shape gut microbial diversity, with a special focus on core and keystone taxa and their health associations.
# 🔍 Why This Study Matters

**Indigenous communities are at the frontline of environmental, cultural, and dietary transitions. Yet, their microbiome landscapes remain understudied.** 
**This work:**
1. **Explores microbial shifts across a lifestyle-ecological continuum (from minimally to highly acculturated groups)**.
2. **Identifies core and keystone microbial taxa crucial to community structure and function**.
3. **Associates microbial features with disease relevance, highlighting health-influencing taxa**.
4. **Contributes toward microbiome-informed public health and conservation strategies for vulnerable populations**.
