## Tracing Gut Microbial Diversity and Keystone Taxa in Indian Tribes: Interplay of Lifestyle, Ecology, and Health
 <img width="2079" height="798" alt="Ankita_work" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70595382-9984-4471-aa89-aff29bec605a" />


This repository hosts the analytical framework, scripts, and metadata associated with a comprehensive study of gut microbiota across five Indian tribal populations. The project investigates how lifestyle transitions, ecological environments, and acculturation shape gut microbial diversity, with a special focus on core and keystone taxa and their health associations.

# Why This Study Matters

**Indigenous communities are at the frontline of environmental, cultural, and dietary transitions. Yet, their microbiome landscapes remain understudied.** 
**This work:**
1. **Explores microbial shifts across a lifestyle-ecological continuum (from minimally to highly acculturated groups)**.
2. **Identifies core and keystone microbial taxa crucial to community structure and function**.
3. **Associates microbial features with disease relevance, highlighting health-influencing taxa**.
4. **Contributes toward microbiome-informed public health and conservation strategies for vulnerable populations**.

## Notes
This study reveals that gut microbiomes in traditional populations are shaped by ecological, cultural, and lifestyle factors, resulting in distinct, population-specific microbial structures. Keystone taxa, despite low abundance, play crucial roles in maintaining community stability and host interactions, but their functions vary with local environments and cultural practices. These findings challenge one-size-fits-all microbiome models and highlight the need for context-aware, culturally sensitive approaches to microbiome research and health interventions in populations facing rapid modernization.
